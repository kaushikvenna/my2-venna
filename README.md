###### My favourite vacation spot is GOA.
Goa has many **beaches** and one can enjoy and experience many **water sports**.If you like water, Goa has it all. This Indian state stretches its coastline along the Arabian Sea, which means thereâ€™s plenty of beach to go around. You can experience **scuba diving** or **snorkeling** in the sea, go on a sport **fishing tour**, try **kitesurfing**, and so much more.Goa also boasts some beautiful rivers, including the **Zuari** and the **Nerul**, which offer calmer activities such as **kayaking** or backwater cruises.
